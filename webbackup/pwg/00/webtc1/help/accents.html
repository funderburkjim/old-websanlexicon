<h2>Accents</h2>
<p>
<strong>This document aims to describe Sanskrit accents appearing
  in the Grosses Petersburger Wörterbuch of Böhtlingk and Roth (PWG).
</strong>
</p>
<p>Sanskrit accents occur throughout the text, and are coded in the
digitization.  
The display of accents takes the form of various decorations
of the text. 
The displays where accents
are available have an option to 'Ignore Accents' (the default) or 'Show Accents'. When the 'Ignore Accents' option is in force, the displays do not show the accents.
<br/>
When a display is configured by the user to show accents, then 
the visual form of the accent decorations in the displays further depends on the user's choice for displaying textual Devanagari.
<br/> Finally, proper display of the accents with Devanagari depends on the use of web fonts (discussed below).

<p> The interested reader may find extensive discussion of various 
representations of Sanskrit accents in the book
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">
Linguistic Issues in Encoding Sanskrit
</span> by Peter M. Scharf and Malcolm D. Hyman, published in 2011.
A pdf version of the book may be found at 
<a href="http://sanskritlibrary.org/">sanskritlibrary.org</a>, in the
Publications section. Our display of accents aims to be consistent with those shown on page 162ff.
</p>

<p>
There are three types of accents that occur in PWG:
<ul>
<li><em>udātta</em>, the acute accent , a high or sharp tone </li>
<li><em>anudātta</em>, the grave accent,  not elevated or raised </li>
<li><em>svarita</em>, a kind of mixed tone , produced by a combination of high and low tone </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<!-- Written by Peter Scharf , 2014 -->
Bohtlingk and Roth use the common system of marking accents with the vertical bar above a svarita vowel and a horizontal bar beneath an anudAtta vowel when they display continuous texts.  On individual words such as headwords, however, they place a Devanagari 'u' above the udAtta vowel and vertical bar above an independent svarita vowel.  The digital encoding of Bohtlingk and Roth's work marked udAttas, anudAttas, and svaritas, but did not distinguish independent from dependent svaritas.  The current display, in both Devanagari and Roman, simply translates the encoding marks into available characters; it does no accent sandhi or interpretation.  The characters selected are appropriate for isolated words, i.e. headwords in particular but use the uncommon Kashmiri marks: vertical bar above an udAtta vowel, hook above an independent svarita vowel.  However, the same marks have been used admittedly inappropriately for the continuous Vedic texts.  Please bear with us while we improve the display of the continuous Vedic passages.

<p>With Devanagari display of Sanskrit, the accents are represented by the
following unicode points:
<ul>
<li> The <em>udātta</em> accent uses unicode code point \u0951, DEVANAGARI STRESS SIGN UDATTA.
</li>
<li>The  <em>anudātta</em> accent uses unicode code point \u0952, DEVANAGARI STRESS SIGN ANUDATTA.
</li>
<li> The <em>svarita</em> accent uses unicode code point \u1ce0, VEDIC TONE RIGVEDIC KASHMIRI INDEPENDENT SVARITA.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Web Fonts</h2>
<p>
As of now (2014), default  Unicode fonts available on personal computers do not include representations for the Unicode code points used for all three accents in Devanagari text. Fortunately, there do exist fonts designed for the display of Devanagari text that do represent these accents. 
Two fonts that we are aware of are:
<ul>
<li>praja_Vedic font designed by Peter Freund; this is a non-free font which may be purchased at the 
<a href="https://secure.bmtmicro.com/servlets/Orders.ShoppingCart?CID=5115&PRODUCTID=51150002">Praja font order page</a>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.svayambhava.org/">Siddhanta</a>, a free font designed by Mihail Bayaryn. 
<br/> <a href="PWG-accents.pdf" target="_blank">See also</a>.

</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Recently, Marcis Gasuns brought to our attention the web technology known as Web Fonts.  For an appropriately coded web page, a web browser  may be instructed to download a font to be used within the web page.  Most modern web browsers support web fonts.  
<br/> We have chosen to use the Siddhanta font as a web font for display of Devanagari with accents.
</p>
<p> This usage requires no font installation by the user; it just works.
The first time that a web page uses a web font, the browser must download the font from our server; this typically results in a short delay for rendering all or part of the page.  However, the browser typically caches a downloaded font, so that subsequent uses of the web page (such as to look up several more words) result in no delay.
</p>
<p> For PWG, web fonts are also used in the display of other text.
<ul>
<li> The <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Old-Standard-TT">Old Standard</a> font designed by Alexey Kryukov is used for the display of most text.
</li>
<li>The Charter Indologique Capital font is used for the display of the larger and smaller capital letters in the literary source references.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<!--
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><span style="color:red;">Warning:</span>  The Devanagari display of the
<em>svarita</em> generally requires the installation of the praja_Vedic font designed by Peter Freund; this is a non-free font which may be purchased at the 
<a href="https://secure.bmtmicro.com/servlets/Orders.ShoppingCart?CID=5115&PRODUCTID=51150002">Praja font order page</a>

If you obtain this
font, you will need to install it according to the (easy) steps appropriate for
your operating system.  On Windows computers, you will also need to select the
praja font as the default font for your browser. This browser installation is
not required for Macintosh OSX.
<br/>On Windows PC (Vista), with praja font installed and active, 
IE9 and Firefox browsers present a more pleasing rendering of Devanagari than Chrome browser.
<br/>On Windows PC (Vista), the rendering of accents is better when the
Times New Roman font is chosen for the browser display font.
<br/>On Macintosh PC, both Devanagari and Roman accents are well displayed
with the praja font.
