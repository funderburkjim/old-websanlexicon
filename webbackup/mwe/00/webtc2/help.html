 <h2>Help for Monier-Williams English-Sanskrit Advanced Search</h2>
<p> This program does partial word searches for English head words or
 other text words and for Sanskrit text words in
 the dictionary. For the basic usage, type a word in the 
 text input box next to 'Sanskrit text word:' or 'English text word/Headword:',
 set the search paramenters, and the maximum and output parameters,
 and click the <input type="button" value="Search" />  button.
A message in the left display pane
indicates the program is working.  When the request is finished, output
appears in the left display pane.
</p>
<p> Instead of clicking the <input type="button" value="Search" />  button,
  one can press the <input type="button" value="Enter" />  key while the
  cursor is in the text input box.  (NOTE: Currently, this is known to
  work properly only when using the Firefox or IE7 browsers with the Windows XP
  operating system. It is known to work improperly for the Safari browser on
  the Macintosh; however, the 'Search' button seems to work ok in this case.) 
</p>
<p> The data in the left pane presents the underlying headwords where
  matches occur;
 if you are searching for a Sanskrit text word, the matching word appears in
 parentheses next to the headword. The head word is clickable.
If clicked, the full record for the word appears in the right-hand pane.
All Sanskrit words appear according to the setting of the 'output' 
parameter.  
</p>
<p>Various controls allow some degree of tuning of the search process and 
of the output format.
 <ul>
  <li> exact/prefix/suffix/substring (Sanskrit or English word). This
   determines where within a possibly longer word the match occurs.
  </li>
  <li> HK/SLP1/ITRANS (Sanskrit word): the transliteration scheme in
      which you input the Sanskrit word. 
      <!-- (<a href="../webtc/help.html">details</a>) -->
  </li>
<!--
  <li> any case (French word): if checked, no account is taken of
       whether the dictionary words appear in upper or lower case.
  </li>
-->
  <li>Maximum: this number determines the maximum number of matches per
      search. Bigger numbers will take longer, of course.
  </li>
  <li>output: This allows a choice of how to represent the Sanskrit words in the
     output, in each pane.
  </li>
  </li>
  <li><input type="button" value="Next" /> button: This button is available after a search in which the
   maximum number of matches did not exhaust the dictionary. In other words,
   there may be more matches.  Clicking the button continues the search, from
   the point at which the prior search ended.
  </li>
 </ul>
</p>

<b>working...</b> workaround
<br/>
Some users have noticed that after a data request is made, 'working...' appears, and then the usual data 
display never appears.  We are aware of this problem, but unsure of how to
prohibit it.  It seems to happen more frequently for some users than for others.
Experience has shown that one of several similar actions can usually
get the user past this problem when it occurs:
-->
<ul>
 <li>Press  <input type="button" value="Search" /> again
 </li>
 <li> OR, Re-enter the search parameters, then press <input type="button" value="Search" /> again.
 </li>
 <li>OR, Press the 'reload' button for your web browser, then re-enter the search parameters, then press <input type="button" value="Search" /> again.
 </li>
</ul>
</p>
<hr/>
<!--
<p>In the hope of greater efficiency, the searching is actually done on
    a text copy of the reference dictionary. The right-hand pane detail
    records are from the reference dictionary itself. Thus, it is possible that
    the two might get out of sync if we fail to recreate the text copy in
    a timely way.  You may want to alert us if you think this is the
    explanation for some curious result.
